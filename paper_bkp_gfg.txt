Question: 1
Suppose that in a C program snippet, followings statements are used.
code
i) sizeof(int);
ii) sizeof(int*);
iii) sizeof(int**);

Assuming size of pointer is 4 bytes and size of int is also 4 bytes, pick the most correct answer from the given options.
1.
Only i) would compile successfully and it would return size as 4.
2.
i), ii) and iii) would compile successfully and size of each would be same i.e. 4
3.
i), ii) and iii) would compile successfully but the size of each would be different and would be decided at run time.
4.
ii) and iii) would result in compile error but i) would compile and result in size as 4.

Question: 2
Assume int is 4 bytes, char is 1 byte and float is 4 bytes. Also, assume that pointer size is 4 bytes (i.e. typical case)
code
char *pChar;
int *pInt;
float *pFloat;

sizeof(pChar);
sizeof(pInt);
sizeof(pFloat);

What’s the size returned for each of sizeof() operator?
1.
4 4 4
2.
1 4 4
3.
1 4 8
4.
None of the above

Question: 3
code
#include "stdlib.h"
int main()
{
 int *pInt;
 int **ppInt1;
 int **ppInt2;

 pInt = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));
 ppInt1 = (int**)malloc(10*sizeof(int*));
 ppInt2 = (int**)malloc(10*sizeof(int*));

 free(pInt);
 free(ppInt1);
 free(*ppInt2);
 return 0;
}

Choose the correct statement w.r.t. above C program.
1.
malloc() for ppInt1 and ppInt2 isn’t correct. It’ll give compile time error.
2.
free(*ppInt2) is not correct. It’ll give compile time error.
3.
free(*ppInt2) is not correct. It’ll give run time error.
4.
No issue with any of the malloc() and free() i.e. no compile/run time error.

Question: 4
code
#include "stdio.h"
int main()
{
 void *pVoid;
 pVoid = (void*)0;
 printf("%lu",sizeof(pVoid));
 return 0;
}

Pick the best statement for the above C program snippet.
1.
Assigning (void *)0 to pVoid isn’t correct because memory hasn’t been allocated. That’s why no compile error but it'll result in run time error.
2.
Assigning (void *)0 to pVoid isn’t correct because a hard coded value (here zero i.e. 0) can’t assigned to any pointer. That’s why it'll result in compile error.
3.
No compile issue and no run time issue. And the size of the void pointer i.e. pVoid would equal to size of int.
4.
sizeof() operator isn’t defined for a pointer of void type.

Question: 8
Consider following two C - program :
code
P1 :
int main()
{
    int (*ptr)(int ) = fun;
    (*ptr)(3);
    return 0;
}

int fun(int n)
{
  for(;n > 0; n--)
    printf("GeeksQuiz ");
  return 0;
}

P2 :
int main()
{
    void demo();
    void (*fun)();
    fun = demo;
    (*fun)();
    fun();
    return 0;
}

void demo()
{
    printf("GeeksQuiz ");
}

Which of the following option is correct?
1.
P1 printed "GeeksQuiz GeeksQuiz" and P2 printed "GeeksQuiz GeeksQuiz"
2.
P1 printed "GeeksQuiz GeeksQuiz" and P2 gives compiler error
3.
P1 gives compiler error and P2 printed "GeeksQuiz GeeksQuiz"
4.

Question: 9
Choose the best statement with respect to following three program snippets.
code
/*Program Snippet 1 with for loop*/
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
   /*statement1*/
   continue;
   /*statement2*/
}

/*Program Snippet 2 with while loop*/
i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
   /*statement1*/
   continue;
   /*statement2*/
   i++;
}

/*Program Snippet 3 with do-while loop*/
i = 0;
do
{
   /*statement1*/
   continue;
   /*statement2*/
   i++;
}while (i < 10);
1.
All the loops are equivalent i.e. any of the three can be chosen and they all will perform exactly same.
2.
continue can't be used with all the three loops in C.
3.
After hitting the continue; statement in all the loops, the next expression to be executed would be controlling expression (i.e. i < 10) in all the 3 loops.
4.
None of the above is correct.
